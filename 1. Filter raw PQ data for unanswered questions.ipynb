However it is estimated that parish communities spent at least Â£130m a year pre-pandemic on church building projects, including repair and maintenance, conservation of collections such as manuscripts, silver and textiles, improvements to accessibility and environmental sustainability, and inclusion of community facilities such as toilets and kitchens. Specialist building firms, craftspeople, archaeologists, conservators and others rely on churches to provide them with work and a training ground for passing their skills on to apprentices and trainees.The vast majority of this money is raised locally and we are grateful to national bodies such as the National Lottery Heritage Fund, National Churches Trust, Wolfson Foundation and Pilgrim Trust, who continue to provide essential grants. The overall maintenance deficit continues to grow since the ending of the dedicated places of worship repair scheme in 2017.  \n",

The Church of England provides resources for those experiencing stress and signposts to other resources from charities and organisations able to help. Some more information is available here: Supporting clergy health and wellbeing | The Church of England As chief pastors in their dioceses, diocesan bishops ensure pastoral care is available to clergy and is provided when needed.The Church of England is committed to supporting those individuals and organisations working to help those at risk of self-harm and suicide. At a parish level many clergy play a key role themselves in providing counselling, comfort and support to those at risk. All suicides are tragedies, and whilst causes will vary, the death of any member of the clergy through suicide will be a matter of profound concern and deep sadness for all in the church, their community and all who have a responsibility for their pastoral care.  \n",

The Faith and Public Life team of the Archbishopâs Council (formerly MPA: the Mission and Public Affairs Division) handles much of the Church of Englandâs national engagement with Government, Parliament and policymakers but also has responsibility for work that is not public affairs. In the transition from MPA to the Faith and Public Life team under the Transforming Effectiveness process, the total number of NCI staff working in those public affairs roles has been cut.The Archbishopsâ Council Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 can be seen here: GS 2211 AC_annual_report_and_financial_statements_for_year_ended_31_December_2020.pdf (churchofengland.org)The Church Commissioners for England Annual Report 2020 can be seen here: https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/Church%20Commissioners%20Annual%20Report%202020.pdf  \n",

During this period the public affairs team at Lambeth Palace comprised a social and public affairs adviser, research officer and a PA. The PA role will be reduced to half time in 2022.  \n",

Strategic Development Funding was granted initially in 2017 for Transforming Mission in Falmouth and further grants were awarded in 2019 to extend the project to Truro, Camborne, St Austell, and Liskeard. Transforming Mission represents a significant investment in parish ministry in the county of Cornwall, benefitting many deprived parishes. While the project has been hit hard by Covid, with disruption meaning detailed and up-to-date data is not available, early signs are that there has been a positive recovery and return to church since the pandemic; although more time will be needed to fully realise its planned outcomes compared to if the pandemic had not happened.Transforming Mission in Falmouth has shown encouraging results, with growth in the existing parish congregation and a new congregation, and increased engagement with the community and university in Falmouth. In Camborne, at the time of the funding award in 2019 the parishes were in regular contact with 20 children and young people per month. By May 2022 this had increased to 460 children and young people, and 230 parents and carers in regular contact with the parishes.  \n",

While not related directly to governance, these may also feature in the learning event and in ongoing conversations with dioceses.From the start of 2023, the new Strategic Mission and Ministry Investment Board (SMMIB), a committee of the Archbishops' Council, has replaced the previous Strategic Investment Board and Strategic Ministry Board. It distributes and monitors funds made available by the Church Commissioners and Archbishops' Council via LInC, SDF, and other similar funds.The Boards of the Archbishopsâ Council and the Church Commissioners are regularly updated by the SMMIB about funding decisions and projects supported by these funds.

       "      <td>The Church Commissioners intend to distribute Â£1.2 billion between 2023 and 2025, up 30% from Â£930 million in the current three-year period, to support the Churchâs mission and ministry, including through parishes across England. The core of the extra funding will be channelled into the revitalisation of parish and local ministry and go some way to continue enabling local parishes to serve their communities and the whole nation. The distributions will help fund diocesesâ plans by reaching more young and disadvantaged people, radically cutting the Churchâs carbon footprint, and addressing issues of racial justice.During the cost of living crisis, the Church Commissioners have worked with the Archbishopsâ Council to provide Â£15 million for dioceses, both rural and urban, to help churches struggling to pay energy costs. The fund will help churches to remain as centres of worship and pastoral care and will also make a key difference in helping churches to continue opening their buildings for vital practical support for their communities over the winter through social action such as food banks and warm hubs.Funding from the Church Commissioners has helped to enable the continued rise in the numbers of ordinands in training, who will be the parish clergy of the future, and the most recent data from the 2020 Ministry Statistics are available here: Ministry Statistics 2020 report . An updated document is in the process of being compiled.</td>\n",

       "      <td>While the primary responsibility for decisions on resourcing mission and ministry rests with the dioceses, the Church Commissioners have provided an extra resource to dioceses (distributed by The Archbishopsâ Council) to support mission and ministry in deprived communities in the form of Lowest Income Communities Funding. Across England, Â£82.1m has been allocated by the Commissioners for this purpose in 2020-22. Recipient dioceses are required to report on their use of this funding to The Archbishopsâ Council each year. The Diocese of Lichfield, which covers Walsall South, will receive over Â£1.7m of this funding in 2021. In 2019, the diocese allocated some Â£200,000 of this to support ministry and mission in parishes in Walsall.The dioceses can also apply for Strategic Development Funding (SDF) for significant projects which support their mission and financial strength, in line with their own strategies. The criteria for this funding seeks to focus on areas of deprivation, and on work with children and young people and within large urban areas. In 2019, Â£1.7million was awarded to Lichfield Diocese to fund a project to enhance mission and ministry in Telford, which includes some of the dioceseâs most deprived areas.A further Â£35m Sustainability Funding has also been made available to help diocese whose income has been reduced by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This funding is focused on those dioceses with fewer historic assets and whose populations have lower average incomes. Grants worth Â£15m were made to 24 dioceses in 2020.</td>\n",

While grant funding is also available from national and local charities, this can only go so far. The Church of England is grateful to the great many congregations and local philanthropists who continue, despite current financial difficulties, to support the work of the Church.Recent reports from the National Churches Trust have shown that every Â£1 invested in a church building returns Â£16 to the community in other services and facilities.

       "35761  The Independent Review of Lowest Income Communities Funding and Strategic Development Funding led by Sir Robert Chote was published in March 2022 and can be read here: https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/irls-final-report-2.pdfIn respect of improving governance arrangements of Lowest Income Communities Funding (LInC) the Review recommended:Recommendation 2 - \"Refocusing annual returns â¦ towards more strategic reporting\".Recommendation 3 - asked staff to \"identify and promote best practice â¦ perhaps convening a learning symposium\".Recommendation 5 â asked staff to \"communicate more clearly the extent to which LInC funding is sustaining ministry\".The action taken so far by the Archbishops' Council's Vision and Strategy team in response to those recommendations has been to:Raise the profile of LInC funding within ongoing strategic conversations between its staff and diocesan teams, as part of dioceses' strategic development processes, with the aim of improving its effectiveness.Ask dioceses to give information about the intended outcomes from their planned use of LInC funding, together with how they will be measured, as part of their annual return on LInC funding for 2022.Plan a learning event to bring together diocesan representatives to share and develop their approaches on the use of LInC funding, aiming to improve the effectiveness, accountability and transparency of LInC funding.The Independent Review also made further suggestions in Recommendation 1: \"encouraging dioceses to use LInC funding more for clergy transitions\" and in Recommendation 4: \"maintaining current levels of LInC funding\". While not related directly to governance, these may also feature in the learning event and in ongoing conversations with dioceses.From the start of 2023, the new Strategic Mission and Ministry Investment Board (SMMIB), a committee of the Archbishops' Council, has replaced the previous Strategic Investment Board and Strategic Ministry Board. It distributes and monitors funds made available by the Church Commissioners and Archbishops' Council via LInC, SDF, and other similar funds.The Boards of the Archbishopsâ Council and the Church Commissioners are regularly updated by the SMMIB about funding decisions and projects supported by these funds.

The core of the extra funding will be channelled into the revitalisation of parish and local ministry and go some way to continue enabling local parishes to serve their communities and the whole nation. The distributions will help fund diocesesâ plans by reaching more young and disadvantaged people, addressing issues of racial justice, and radically cutting the Churchâs carbon footprint. By providing help for net zero programmes, and access to experts in renewable heating advice, parishes will be helped with their plans to replace gas and oil heating systems.  \n",

A series of structured interviews have been held with every diocese, including with the Diocese of Lichfield at the beginning of May.

The core of the extra funding will be channelled into the revitalisation of parish and local ministry and go some way to continue enabling local parishes to serve their communities and the whole nation. The distributions will help fund diocesesâ plans by reaching more young and disadvantaged people, radically cutting the Churchâs carbon footprint, and addressing issues of racial justice.During the cost of living crisis, the Church Commissioners have worked with the Archbishopsâ Council to provide Â£15 million for dioceses, both rural and urban, to help churches struggling to pay energy costs. The fund will help churches to remain as centres of worship and pastoral care and will also make a key difference in helping churches to continue opening their buildings for vital practical support for their communities over the winter through social action such as food banks and warm hubs.Funding from the Church Commissioners has helped to enable the continued rise in the numbers of ordinands in training, who will be the parish clergy of the future, and the most recent data from the 2020 Ministry Statistics are available here: Ministry Statistics 2020 report .

Across England, Â£82.1m has been allocated by the Commissioners for this purpose in 2020-22. Recipient dioceses are required to report on their use of this funding to The Archbishopsâ Council each year. The Diocese of Lichfield, which covers Walsall South, will receive over Â£1.7m of this funding in 2021. In 2019, the diocese allocated some Â£200,000 of this to support ministry and mission in parishes in Walsall.The dioceses can also apply for Strategic Development Funding (SDF) for significant projects which support their mission and financial strength, in line with their own strategies. The criteria for this funding seeks to focus on areas of deprivation, and on work with children and young people and within large urban areas. In 2019, Â£1.7million was awarded to Lichfield Diocese to fund a project to enhance mission and ministry in Telford, which includes some of the dioceseâs most deprived areas.A further Â£35m Sustainability Funding has also been made available to help diocese whose income has been reduced by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This funding is focused on those dioceses with fewer historic assets and whose populations have lower average incomes. Grants worth Â£15m were made to 24 dioceses in 2020.  \n",

The Church Commissioners, as the appeal body for any formal parish reorganisation, are unable to comment further as it may prejudice future decisions of the Mission, Pastoral, and Church Property Committee should Leicester Diocese decide to bring forward formal parish reorganisation proposals.Enquiries about the Minster Communities plan should be directed to the offices of the Bishop of Leicester, the Archdeacon of Leicester or the Archdeacon of Loughborough.

During the visit, the Archbishop met with those who had lost loved ones as a result of the 7 October attacks. Several dioceses are supporting humanitarian appeals to support the ongoing work of the AlâAhli Hospital.The Archbishop of Canterburyâs most recent comments on the issue of Israel and Gaza can be found here: https://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/news/news-and-statements  \n",

Despite being commissioned by the Government, the Government has yet to respond.The Church Commissioners are providing Â£11million in funding for 2023-25 to support a new âBuildings for Missionâ programme to provide support, through dioceses, to local parishes with the challenges they face in maintaining their church buildings.National grant funding is no longer ring-fenced for religious buildings despite the largest number of listed buildings in the country being from that classification. While grant funding is also available from national and local charities, this can only go so far. The Church of England is grateful to the great many congregations and local philanthropists who continue, despite current financial difficulties, to support the work of the Church.Recent reports from the National Churches Trust have shown that every Â£1 invested in a church building returns Â£16 to the community in other services and facilities. If the Church can spend less time on repairing buildings, an even greater focus could be given to supporting the communities it serves. The evidence for this can be found in the 2021 House of Good report, available at: House of Good 2021  \n",

The Church providesâ¯yourchurchwedding.orgâ¯as a resource to couples seeking information about all aspects of a church wedding, and this has proven to be a popular resource which is now used by over a million couples a year.The General Synod and Parliament approve the fees charged by the parishes of the Church of England for these and other services via the Parochial Fees Order. Details of the current fees set for 2021 can be found here:https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2020-11/Parochial%20Fees%20A4_21.pdfThe cost of getting married in a church remains very modest when compared to other locations. Weddings are bespoke services, and all churches have a basic charge that covers the ceremony, including the calling of banns, the banns certificate, marriage certificate, and administration cost. Should a couple wish to opt for bells, choir, organist and flowers, etc. they are arranged by the parish for an additional fee to cover people's time and additional administration costs. An incumbent priest also has the discretion to waive some of the fees for pastoral reasons.The National Church Life Events team has worked with Archdeacons across the country to encourage all parishes to distinguish between the statutory fee and additional charges clearer. The local Archdeacon would be best placed to discuss any individual case.  \n",

Every effort is made to appoint suitable candidates swiftly, however an interregnum is often necessary to allow the Vacancy in See Committee to consult on and produce an up to date statement of needs. Suffragan bishop appointments are overseen by the diocesan bishop, who is required to present a role description to the Dioceses Commission so that an assessment can be made of mission and ministry needs, capacity and resources in the diocese. Parish priest appointments are a matter for diocesan bishops.  \n",

In 2021 the Commissioners also purchased land in Wales with the intention of establishing a new woodland of c.85,000 new trees (subject to the grant of planting permissions).Across the land portfolio the Commissioners have conducted numerous woodland reviews assessing opportunities for new planting schemes, creating wildlife corridors. Via the implementation of environmental land management schemes farm tenants are planting more hedgerows and the Commissioners are encouraging the inclusion of in-hedge trees.  "

       "      <td>Management of a diocese and the ordering of parishes is a matter for the diocesan bishop and their senior staff, not the National Church Institutions (NCIs).The NCIs are aware that in October 2021, 72% of members of the Leicester Diocesan Synod voted in favour of the Minster Community model. The Church Commissioners, as the appeal body for any formal parish reorganisation, are unable to comment further as it may prejudice future decisions of the Mission, Pastoral, and Church Property Committee should Leicester Diocese decide to bring forward formal parish reorganisation proposals.Enquiries about the Minster Communities plan should be directed to the offices of the Bishop of Leicester, the Archdeacon of Leicester or the Archdeacon of Loughborough.

       "      <td>Between 2010 and 2019, 209 consecrated churches were formally closed, which amounted to just over 1%. Since the 1990s the rate of closure has remained steady at 20-25 per year out of a total of around 16,000 church buildings. It is important to note that new churches are also being built and that some congregations meet in other kinds of buildings.More information can be found in the annual reports of the Church Commissioners, which are available in the House of Commons Library, or online here, in the sections for âMission, Pastoral and Church Propertyâ or âPastoral Administrationâ: https://www.churchofengland.org/about/leadership-and-governance/church-commissioners-england/how-we-are-governed/publicationsChurches are first and foremost places of worship. The 2017 Taylor Review into sustainability of English Churches and Cathedrals ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/669667/Taylor_Review_Final.pdf ) found that the Government could also enable the church to serve local communities better by reviewing planning law around listed buildings, to enable Local Authorities to think more imaginatively about diversification and wider use. For over a decade the Church of Englandâs own âopen and sustainable churchesâ programme, has encouraged churches to consider partnering with a wide variety of community resources (e.g. post offices, village shops, childrenâs play areas, credit unions, foodbanks, co-working spaces) in sharing space: Sharing your building and finding partners | The Church of England</td>\n",

The content of the rite of Baptism remains the same for all.Clergy are required by canon law to ensure that all who come to Baptism as adults are given appropriate teaching on the tenets of the faith and in encouragement to private spiritual devotion. Therefore, the preparation process may require specific, lengthier input and instruction of some groups of candidates before the clergyperson is confident of the independent faith of each individual.  \n",

Analysis of the Â£471million giving reported in 2020 Parish Finance Statistics indicates that 44% came from these parishes in rural areas.

The most recent data available on the number of stipendiary curates can be found in the one off special project published in 2015 called 'Released for mission, growing the rural church', which is available here: https://www.churchofengland.org/news-and-media/news-and-statements/released-mission-growing-rural-churchFor more than a decade the Church Commissioners have financially supported dioceses to increase the number of ordinands they can afford to send for training. Funding has recently been allocated to dioceses through the Ministry Division of the NCIs to ensure ordinands can be supported in posts of first responsibility. This month the Church Commissioners announced a further grant (through the Strategic Mission & Ministry Investment Board of the Archbishopsâ Council) of Â£5.6 million to continue to support curates as they move into their next posts.

       "34278  Between 2010 and 2019, 209 consecrated churches were formally closed, which amounted to just over 1%. Since the 1990s the rate of closure has remained steady at 20-25 per year out of a total of around 16,000 church buildings. It is important to note that new churches are also being built and that some congregations meet in other kinds of buildings.More information can be found in the annual reports of the Church Commissioners, which are available in the House of Commons Library, or online here, in the sections for âMission, Pastoral and Church Propertyâ or âPastoral Administrationâ: https://www.churchofengland.org/about/leadership-and-governance/church-commissioners-england/how-we-are-governed/publicationsChurches are first and foremost places of worship. The 2017 Taylor Review into sustainability of English Churches and Cathedrals ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/669667/Taylor_Review_Final.pdf ) found that the Government could also enable the church to serve local communities better by reviewing planning law around listed buildings, to enable Local Authorities to think more imaginatively about diversification and wider use. For over a decade the Church of Englandâs own âopen and sustainable churchesâ programme, has encouraged churches to consider partnering with a wide variety of community resources (e.g. post offices, village shops, childrenâs play areas, credit unions, foodbanks, co-working spaces) in sharing space: Sharing your building and finding partners | The Church of England  "
